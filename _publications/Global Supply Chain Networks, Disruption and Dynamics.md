excerpt: >
  Supply chain disruption has become a hot topic in recent years and
  has led to worldwide concerns. Major challenges include geopolitical
  disturbances (e.g., trade wars, supply chain malfunctions, production
  interruptions) and revolutionary technological breakthroughs (e.g.,
  electric vehicles, smartphones, GPUs). In this paper, we perform an
  ex post analysis to explore the outcomes of a supply chain disruptive
  event.

**Research Objective:**  
In this paper, we investigate what happens when a significant supply chain
disruption occurs. We conduct an **ex post** analysis to trace the impacts
across all tiers of a global network.

**Model Framework:**  
We assume a set of heterogeneous firms making forward-looking decisions
to enter or exit specific supply chain tiers, supported by an efficient
financial market. Products are differentiated but substitutable downstream,
so each firm holds a local monopoly, yet can sell to downstream buyers
at discounted terms.

**Macro Scope Analysis:**  
- We examine how prices and output quantities at each tier adjust over time.  
- We assess the implications for end-market customers: do they face higher
  prices or reduced quality?

**Micro Scope Analysis:**  
- We study the financial performance of a representative incumbent firm
  following a disruptive shock.  
- We measure changes in profitability, leverage, and investment behavior.
