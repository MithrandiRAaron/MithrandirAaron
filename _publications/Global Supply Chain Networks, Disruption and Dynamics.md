**Research Objective:**  
This paper investigates the ex post impacts of disruptive events—such as natural disasters, revolutionary technological breakthroughs, or geopolitical conflicts—on the structure and performance of global supply chains.

**Model Framework:**  
- Firms are heterogeneous and forward-looking, making strategic decisions to enter or exit the supply chain network.  
- Intermediate goods are differentiated but substitutable in downstream markets.  
- Switching partners incurs significant costs, and an efficient financial market facilitates firm behavior.

**Macro Scope Analysis:**  
- Characterize how network structure, equilibrium prices, and output quantities adjust over time following a disruption.  
- Identify resilience thresholds and conditions that lead to potential supply chain breakdowns.  
- Assess the downstream impact on end‐market consumers (e.g., price spikes, quality changes).

**Micro Scope Analysis:**  
- Examine the financial performance of a representative incumbent firm—tracking profitability, leverage, and investment behavior—after a disruptive shock.  
- Analyze how switching costs and market efficiency shape firm‐level resilience.

**Expected Contributions:**  
- Provide a dynamic general equilibrium model of supply chain resilience.  
- Offer policy insights into mitigating disruption risk at both firm and network levels.
