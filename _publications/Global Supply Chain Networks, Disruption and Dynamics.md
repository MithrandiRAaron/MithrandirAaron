This paper develops a firm-level supply chain network to investigate
the ex post impacts of disruptive events—such as natural disasters, revolutionary
technological breakthroughs, or geopolitical conflicts—on global supply
chains. Our model incorporates several key assumptions: (1) firms are heterogeneous
and forward-looking, making strategic decisions about entering or exiting
the supply chain network; (2) intermediate goods are differentiated and substitutable
in downstream markets; and (3) switching supply chain partners entails
significant costs for firms. Under these assumptions, we formulate a dynamic
general equilibrium model to characterize the equilibrium of the supply chain
network and evaluate its performance from two perspectives. At the macro level,
we explore how the overall structure and resilience of the supply chain evolve
following a disruptive event and identify conditions leading to potential supply
chain breakdowns. We also analyze the adjustments in equilibrium prices and
quantities across supply chain tiers and assess the consequent impacts on end
market consumers. At the micro level, we specifically examine how disruptive
events influence the market performance of prominent incumbent firms within
the supply chain network. Our results demonstrate that, given the presence of
switching costs and the facilitation of an efficient financial market, the global
supply chain network can exhibit substantial stability and resilience in response
to disruptive shocks.
