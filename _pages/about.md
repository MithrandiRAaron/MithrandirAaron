# About me 
Pengyu Wang is a Ph.D. student in the Information Systems & Operations Management (ISOM) department at the [Foster School of Business](https://foster.uw.edu/academics/degree-programs/phd-program/){:target="_blank"}, [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"}. He holds a B.A. in Honors Economics from [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/){:target="_blank"} and an M.Sc. in Economics from [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

At Madison, Pengyu served as a research assistant to [Prof. Michał Rostek](https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~mrostek/){:target="_blank"} in financial market microstructure and to [Prof. Kim Ruhl](https://www.kimjruhl.com/){:target="_blank"} in international trade. These experiences laid the foundation for his enduring interest in financial economics and global supply-chain challenges.

At UW, he is co-advised by [Prof. Shi Chen](https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/directory/shi-chen/){:target="_blank"}, [Prof. Yong-Pin Zhou](https://faculty.washington.edu/yongpin/){:target="_blank"}, and [Prof. Masha Shunko](https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/directory/masha-shunko/){:target="_blank"}. His research is rooted in modern advances in game-theoretic economic modeling, structural estimation, multi-agent frameworks, online learning, and data-driven decision making. He is passionate about addressing complex industry and supply-chain problems with cutting-edge techniques; his current work focuses on mean-field games and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).
