I played mobile games such as, Wuthering Waves, Ark Knights, Honor of Kings, etc.
I also play 3A games on PC: Elden Ring, Black Myth Wukong, Final Fantasy VII Remake, XIV, XV, XVI, Assassin's Creed series, Baldur's Gate, Call of Duty series, etc. 
I am also fascinated in sandbox strategic games: Heart of Iron series, Crusader King III, Victoria, Mount & Blade II, Total War series, etc.
