I am a great fan of The Lord of The Rings series and The Hobbits. One of my dream is to become a legendary writer like J.R.R.Tolkein. I am also a great fan for ENYA!!! May It Be, an evening star would shine on you and bless for all your future journeys. 

If you are also a great fan of legends and medieval ages, such as, sword and magic, knight and dragons, please LET ME KNOW!!!
