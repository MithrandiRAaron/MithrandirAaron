I started playing piano when I was eight or nine. Ever since, I’ve played from time to time as I’ve grown older. I’m not an excellent player, but I play enough to entertain myself.

**A collection of songs I’ve played:**
- My Heart Will Go On  
- 白夜（True Light）  
- River Flows in You  
- 梁祝（Butterfly Lovers）  
- Summer  
- 天空之城  
- Croatian Rhapsody
