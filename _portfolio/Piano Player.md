I started playing piano when I was eight or nine. After since, I play from time to time when I get more ages. I am not a excellent player, but it is enough for me to entertain myself.
A collection of songs I played:
* My heart will go on
* 白夜 （True Light）
* River flows in you
* 梁祝 （Butterfly Lovers）
* Summer
* 天空之城
* Croatian Rhapsody
